***Careful:*** *here be dragons!*  
**Glucose is not maintained any longer and was never finished.**

What is Glucose?
----------------
Glucose is an ORM that aims to be easy to learn and use.
It uses convention over configuration and provides you with transparent
semi-singletons for each database entry.
